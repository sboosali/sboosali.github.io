### `Evolution Charm`

References: `Emerald Charm`.

### `Fatal Frenzy`

`Fatal Frenzy` is a color-shifted (to Red) and modernized `Berserk`. modernized because: the templating of (the original) `Berserk` permitted efficient & mono-green Creature Removal, by targeting a creature you don't control (even one that hadn't attacked).

### `Essence Warden`

### `Rough // Tumble`

`2 damage to each non-flyer` or `6 damage to each flyer`.

### `Bog Serpent`

`Bog Serpent` is a color-shifted `Sea Serpent`. this makes more sense, because in 2004 (and later), Black cares about `Swamp`s more than Blue cares about `Island`s (earlier, `High Tide`s were more frequent than `Corrupt`s).

References: `Prodigal Sorcerer`.

### `Harmonize`

`Harmonize` is a color-shifted `Concentrate`. 

Card Draw makes sense in Green: 

* Green needs extra cards to play (and Mana Sinks), to spend its extra mana (trom Ramp) on.
* Green cares about lands, and unlike most Card Advantage or Card Selection effects (e.g. Mulch Effects, Quickdraw (some), Tutors, Scrying (by the Mid Game), etc) Card Draw *draws* Lands.

### `Pyrohemia`

`Pyrohemia` is a color-shifted `Pestilence`.

### `Porphyry Nodes`

`Porphyry Nodes` is a color-shifted `Drop of Honey`. White gets Wrath Effects (Green does not), and gets Creature Removal that cares about Power.

References: `Drop of Honey`.

### `Reckless Wurm`

`Reckless Wurm` is a color-shifted `Arrogant Wurm`. this makes sense, because:

* Red, and Black (not Green), are the strongest `Madness` colors, as Red has many Discard Outlets.
