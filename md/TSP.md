# `TSP` (Time Spiral)

## Jargon

"Sliverized" — to "Sliverize" a creature, keep its mana cost and its power/toughness, replace its subtype(s) with `Sliver`, and replace its text from `ABILITY` to `All Slivers have "ABILITY"`.

"Modernized" — to "modernize" a card, its templating may be cleaned up, deprecated keywords are replaced (e.g. `Islandwalk` becoming `Flying`), obsolete mechanics are replaced too (e.g. Color Hosing becoming Ability Hosing, like Blue Hate becoming Instant Hate or Flying Hate); e.g. Ante and Graveyard Order Matters become removed).

### `Magus of the Jar`

>  {T}, Sacrifice ~: Each player exiles all cards from their hand face down and draws seven cards. At the beginning of the next end step, each player discards their hand and returns to their hand each card they exiled this way.

a `Magus` of (the artifact) `Memory Jar`. `{3}{U}{U}` shares the same c.m.c. as `{5}`.

in the artwork, the Magus is holding the eponymous jar (which looks like the original artwork, but instead of being shattered, it's glowing).

References: `Memory Jar`.

### `Magus of the Mirror`

> {T}, Sacrifice ~: Exchange life totals with target opponent. Activate this ability only during your upkeep.

a `Magus` of (the artifact) `Mirror Universe`. `{4}{B}{B}` shares the same c.m.c. as `{6}`.

in the artwork, the Magus is holding the eponymous mirror (with shares the same weird black bubbles as the original artwork).

a `Magus` of (the artifact) `Candelabra of Tawnos`. `{G}` shares the same c.m.c. as `{1}`.

in the artwork, the Magus is holding the eponymous candelabra (with its six candles in their distinctive pattern, like the original artwork).

### `Fortune Thief`

> Damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.

`Fortune Thief` is `Ali from Cairo` with `Morph`.

this Damage Reduction ability synergizes with `Morph` (and with Instants, as in `Angel's Grace`) because: it surprise an opponent whose committed resources (e.g. mana, cards like burn spells, attacking creatures) to finishing you.

References: `Ali from Cairo`.

### `Thelonite Hermit`

`Thelonite Hermit` is a `Deranged Hermit` with:

* `Echo` becoming `Morph`
* `Squirrel` becoming `Saproling`

`Morph`, like `Echo`, is an extra cost (you pay both the casting cost and the echo cost, as you pay both `{3}` and the morph cost).

`Saproling`s is a tribe in `TSP` (unlike `Squirrel`s in `UL`).

References: `Deranged Hermit`.

> Amrou Scout
> Creature - Kithkin Rebel Scout
> {4}, {T}: Search your library for a Rebel permanent card with converted mana cost 3 or less and put it onto the battlefield. Then shuffle your library.
> 2/1

`Amrou Scout` is a `2/1` while `Ramosian Lieutenant` was a `1/2`. As `@killgoldfish` says in their Time Spiral Block Review (<http://blog.killgold.fish/2014/10/kill-reviews-time-spiral.html>):

> The first card by collector’s number is Amrou Scout.
> A 2/1 creature is generally considered a bit better than 1/2, but more importantly, it’s a more aggressive set of stats. It gives you a meaningful choice of whether you’d like to get in there for two damage, or have it stay back and tutor; attacking for one is much less impressive. Additionally, a 1/2 could plausibly stay back on defense against some crappy 1/1 creature to neutralize it, then still activate at end of turn. A 2/1 is going to lead to more interactive gameplay than a 1/2, because of the turns of attacking it encourages.
> How does it relate to the rest of the block? The three-mana slot for rebels gives the tribe a lot of options. In the set itself, there are multiple two-power three-mana white rebels to tutor for that are useful in different ways. Then, as with many tutors, its ability changes as more cards are added to the pool: Planar Chaos gives this lowly 2/1 the ability to gain life with a temporary flier, hose a black deck, and even branch into black to destroy a big creature. Then in Future Sight, it can even get a bona fide removal spell. Just as Magic changes with the passing of time, the same common on Time Spiral evolves with the block.
> But there’s even more buried in the card. Why is it a kithkin, of all things? Of course, it’s a reference to an old, obscure card, Amrou Kithkin. Why that? It could be anything. But if the card could be anything, from a flavor standpoint, why not give it that bit of added depth by calling back to Legends? It makes perfect sense that, in a set about Magic’s past, an obscure race would turn into the rebels. Oh… and multiple kithkin in the set, including this one, are illustrated by Quinton Hoover, the original illustrator of that card.

> Amrou Kithkin
> Creature - Kithkin

`skips their next untap step` is similar to `exert`ing all their lands, creatures, artifacts.

### Call to the Netherworld


>{B} Sorcery
>Return target black creature card from your graveyard to your hand. 
>Madness {0}

note the conditional `target black creature card` text, versus a (hypothetical) unconditional `target creature card`. because the `madness` cost has no black mana, "gating" the effect with a color-restriction preserves the Color Pie. otherwise, for example, Mono-Red would get a Creature Regrowth effect (via one of Red's many Discard Outlets).

### `Barbed Shocker`

>Trample, haste
> Whenever Barbed Shocker deals damage to a player, that player discards all the cards in their hand, then draws that many cards.
> 2/2

the `opponent discards all the cards in their hand, then draws that many cards` text (i love it).

> Fervid shamans willingly submit to shockers in hopes of glimpsing the fortunes of the future.


the flavor text bends the 4th Wall with "some players don't block it".

### `Aspect Of Mongoose`

an `Aura` that grants `Shroud`; `Shroud` is ability that's associated with *mongeese*.

References: `Blurred Mongoose`.

### `Castle Raptors`

> Castle

References: `Castle`.

### `Cavalry Master`

> Other creatures you control with flanking have flanking. (Each instance of flanking triggers separately.)

note the `Each instance of <ABILITY> triggers separately` reminder-text. this educates the player that the `flanking` ability "stacks".

### `Careful Consideration`

> Instant
> Target player draws four cards, then discards three cards. If you cast this spell during your main phase, instead that player draws four cards, then discards two cards.

the `If you cast this spell during your main phase, instead ...` text became "ability-worded" in `Addendum`.

### `Bogardan Rager`

a Creature with Flash and an ETB Trigger is both an ambushing blocker and a Combat Trick (in any Step of either Combat Phase).

### `Deathspore Thallid`

> {1}{B} Fungus

> Remove three spore counters from Deathspore Thallid: Create a 1/1 green Saproling creature token.
> Sacrifice a Saproling: Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.

this color-shifts `Deathspore Thallid` from Green (introduced a decade earlier in `Fallen Empires (FEM)`) to Black; which makes sense since Black ubiquitously sacrifices creatures.

`Deathspore Thallid` is the first black `Thallid`. When `Dominaria` reprinted `Thallid`s, it agreed with `Time Spiral`: it printed three black `Thallid`s; two *only* `sacrifice`d creatures (i.e. they didn't `create` them).

### `Bonesplitter Sliver`

> All Sliver creatures get +2/+0.

References: `Bonesplitter`.

### `Gemhide Sliver`

> All Slivers have " {T}: Add one mana of any color."


`Sliver`s are a five-color tribe; thus, Mana Fixing is important for the `Sliver` tribe, and `Gemhide Sliver` turns every `Sliver` into a Rainbow Mana Dork.

>{1}{W}{W} - 1/2 - Human Cleric Archer
>{T}: D'Avenant Healer deals 1 damage to target attacking or blocking creature. 
>{T}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.


`D'Avenant Healer` unions `D'Avenant Archer` and `Samite Healer`: their activated abilities, creature types, and names.

References: `D'Avenant Archer`, `Samite Healer`.

### `Draining Whelk`

`Draining Whelk` references `Mana Drain`:

* the eponymous "whelk" comes from the (original) artwork of `Mana Drain`
* the (non-commensurate) "put X +1/+1 counters" text parallels the (original) "add X mana" text.

### `Dead Return`

`Dead Return`'s Flavor Text:

> Those who forget the horrors of the past are doomed to re-meet them.

is a statement (perhaps) about learning from previous sets design mistakes.

### `Conflagrate`

> {X}{X}{R} Sorcery
> Conflagrate deals X damage divided as you choose among any number of targets.
> Flashback - {R}{R}, Discard X cards. (You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)

i love that the costs, `{X}{X}` and `Discard X cards`, are both steep costs.

`Flowstone Channeler` is a `Spellshaper` that "casts" `Flowstone Strike`.

### `Krosan Grip`

`Krosan Grip` is a `Split second` `Disenchant`.

`Split second` synergizes with Removal (especially Instant Removal): they can't counter it, they can't activate the artifact in response, the cast do something completely different that benefits from the enchantment, etc.

### `Evangelize`

> {4}{W} Sorcery
> Buyback {2}{W}{W}
> Gain control of target creature of an opponent's choice they control.

the final `Buyback` is expensive (9 c.m.c.). but the card has self-synergy, which makes it interesting `Buyback` card.

> Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has flying.
> When enchanted creature dies, create a 2/2 white Griffin creature token with flying.

Flavor: the enchanted creature rides a griffin; when the enchanted creature dies, the griffin survives; i.e. this card is a "griffin mount".

`Griffin Guide` is similar to `Bestow` (e.g. `Nimbus Naiad`, which also becomes a Wind Drake when the creature dies).

`Riftwing Cloudskate` has `Suspend 3` while `Cloudskate` has `Fading 3`; `Riftwing Cloudskate`'s `Suspend` Cost is `Cloudskate`'s Casting Cost. Interestingly, `Fading` (whose cousin, `Vanishing`, was introduced in `PLC`) and `Suspend` parallel each other; `Suspend 3` means "pay less to get it three turns later" while `Fading 3` means "pay less to get it for only three turns".

### `Teferi, Mage Of Zhalfir`

> Flash

the `Each opponent can cast spells only any time they could cast a sorcery.` line:

* is a Suspend Hoser — if you flash in `Teferi` during their upkeep, due to the `When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.` line (in the Reminder Text of `Suspend`)
* is an Instant Hoser — Instants are Soft-Hosed, you can still cast them as Sorceries for less value; "Interrupts", like Counterspells, are Hard-Hosed, you can't cast them proactively.

### `Serra Avenger`

> You can't cast this spell during your first, second, or third turns of the game.

the `You can't cast this spell during your ... turns of the game.` line is unique. it plays with *the value of time* in MTG, like `Suspend` does. 

`Serra Avenger` is "worth" 4 c.m.c., costs 2 c.m.c., but can't be cast until Turn 4.

### `Think Twice`
