# Counterspells 👏 Counterspells 👏 Counterspells 👏


## Counterspells are "Active"

counter spells and hidden information: unlike most other interactions, Kenner spells are "active". by which I mean...

* Coerce Effects are proactive, as are Taxing Effects — you must cast them before the opponent casts their threat.
* Destroy Effects are reactive — you must cast them after the opponent casts their threat *and* after that threat resolves, which triggers enter the battlefield abilities, Planeswalker loyalty abilities, artifact activated abilities, and even some combat (for haste creatures, or if you delay).
* but Counterspells are *active* — they only work when the opponent is casting a spell, neither before nor after. you have to hold up mana, which gets wasted if they don't say anything, or if they play something that's not good enough to spend the counter on, *or* when your counter is restricted and their spell is uncountable by it (e.g. you don't play a `Young Pyromancer` to leave up `Pyroblast`, and they play a nonblue card).
