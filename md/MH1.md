### `Cabal Therapist`

{B} 1/1
Menace
At the beginning of your precombat main phase, you may sacrifice a creature. When you do, choose a nonland card name, then target player reveals their hand and discards all cards with that name.

* `Cabal Therapy`

Notes:

* `Seasoned Pyromancer`, like `Young Pyromancer`, creates (`1/1` red Elemental) tokens. 
* Cremate for Effect —

    - acts like `Unearth`, a *Creature Flashback* mechanic, because the Cremation effect is (similar to) the Entrance effect.
    - good in multiples: `Seasoned Pyromancer` can discard other `Seasoned Pyromancer`s for double-value: first, being a nonland card, a token does get created; then, having its Graveyard Ability, another two tokens can be created.

* `Young Pyromancer`

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell or activate an ability, if that spell’s mana cost or that ability’s activation cost contains {X}, copy that spell or ability. You may choose new targets for the copy.

the *Artwork* shows Hydra (with many heads) — most Hydras cost `{X}`, so casting a Hydra under an `Unbound Flourishing` doubles its power.

`Mother Bear`'s *Cremation Ability* is similar to `Seasoned Pyromancer`'s, both:

Notes:

* most `Modular` creatures are *Constructs*.
* many *Artifact Creatures* are *Constructs*.
* Sacrificing and `Modular` synergize (c.f. `Arcbound Ravager`). Sacrificing a `Modular` creature moves its `+1/+1` Counters.

### `Astral Drift`

{2}{W} Enchantment

### `Sling-Gang Lieutenant`

Goblin

Farmstead Gleaner doesn’t untap during your untap step.
{2}, {Q}: Put a +1/+1 counter on Farmstead Gleaner. ({Q} is the untap symbol.)

Notes:

* `{Q}` mitigates `~ doesn’t untap during your untap step`. `Farmstead Gleaner` is a first card with the *Untap Symbol* that has the *Locked Drawback* (but not the first *Locked Permanent* which has an activated ability or triggered ability which untaps itself, e.g. `Basalt Monolith` from *Alpha*).

### `Winds of Abandon`

{1}{W} Sorcery
Exile target creature you don’t control. For each creature exiled this way, its controller searches their library for a basic land card. Those players put those cards onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle their libraries.

* a *targeted* `Settle the Wreckage`.

## Notes

### Pseudo-Reprints

`MH1` prints variants of old cards which greatly benefit their standard formats and/or other eternal formats:

* `Force of Negation` is a *modernized* `Force of Will` (is weaker, has no `pay 1 life` cost)
* `Astral Drift` is a *modernized* `Astral Slide` (only triggers off your cycling).

Interestingly, LSV (with TSG), wished for FoW and Slide to be reprinted in Modern. After banning dozens of interesting cards (e.g. `Birthing Pod`, `Cloudpost`, `Green Sun's Zenith`, `Preordain`, `Splinter Twin`, etc) and waiting several years, Wizards finally did so.
