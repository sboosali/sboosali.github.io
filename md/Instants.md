# Instants trump Color Pie

## Magic the Gathering

Magic the Gathering has several important *features*, including:

* the Color Pie
* the Mana Curve
* Instants
* Variance (via shuffling)
* Aesthetics (good artwork, consistent layout, etc)
* a Specification (the *Comprehensive Rules*)

Only ① instants and ② a specification are unique (among popular games).

Instants are the most important. 

## Instants

by "*Instants*", I mean cards with:

* the `Instant` card type.
* the `Flash` keyword.
* activated abilities in hidden zones (e.g. mechanics like `Cycling` plus a discard-trigger, or `Channel`, `Bloodrush`, and others; e.g. cards like `Faerie Macabre`).

## Color Pie

Mark Rosewater, a designer at Wizards, wrote this (in 2003):

>I believe the color pie is the heart of the game.

I agree that the colie pie is *at the core* of the game, but disagree that it's *the heart* of the game. The heart of the game is **interaction**.

## Instants

Kinds of Instants:

*  Instants — e.g. ` `. 
* "Their Turn" Instants — e.g. `Siren's Call`. The card has to be used on the opponent's turn. 
* Combat Instants — e.g. `Angelic Favor`. The card can only be played in combat.
* Stack Instants — e.g. `Counterspell`. The card has to target a card on the stack.
* Reactive Instants — e.g. ` `. Cards that don't *need* instant-speed timing, but that *want* instant-speed timing (for richer gameplay).
