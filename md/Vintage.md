# Vintage MTG

Vintage is the Best MTG Format (or, Why I Love Vintage).

## Fact or Fiction

`Fact or Fiction` as framing device.

Fiction: most games end on Turn One. Vintage has *Zero-Mana* Counterspells/Traps, and thus *Turn-Zero* Interaction. `Dark Ritual`s get `Mental Misstep`ped; `Demonic Tutor`s get `Force of Will`ed; `Tendrils of Agony` gets `Mindbreak Trap`ped; and so on.

Fact: some games can end on Turn One. while most games end by Turn Five (but each turn is longer).
