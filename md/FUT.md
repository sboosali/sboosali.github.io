### `Angel Of Salvation`

> When Angel of Salvation enters the battlefield, prevent the next 5 damage that would be dealt this turn to any number of targets, divided as you choose.

`Bogardan Hellkite` deals damage, `Angel Of Salvation` prevents damage (as much damage, i.e. `5`); since Dealing Damage is stronger than Preventing Damage (as manifest in `Lightning Bolt` versus `Healing Salve`), `Angel Of Salvation` is cheaper than `Bogardan Hellkite`, via `Convoke`.
